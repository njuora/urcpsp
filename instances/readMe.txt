The test instances are originally presented in the paper Liu, Y., Zhou, J., Lim, A., & Hu, Q. (2021). Lower bounds and heuristics for the unit-capacity resource constrained project scheduling problem with transfer times.

The 432 test instances correspond to different scenarios for unit-capacity resource constrained project scheduling problem with transfer times. The process of generating instances is based on the works of (Kolisch et al., 1995;Kolisch & Sprecher, 1997), and the instances are generated by modifying the well-known instances for the resource constrained project scheduling problem published on PSPLIB library.

Instance name: jn_m_index.rcp
n -- the number of non-dummy activities
m -- the number of unit-capacity resources
index -- 1 ≤ index ≤ 27
e.g, j30_4_1.rcp

Each instance is characterized by the following parameters:
(1) n: the number of non-dummy activities, {30, 60, 90, 120}
(2) m: the number of unit-capacity resources, {4, 6, 8, 10}
(3) network complexity: {1.50, 1.80, 2.10}
(4) resource factor: {0.25, 0.50, 0.75}
(5) transfer factor:{0.25, 0.50, 0.75}
Please refer to the paper "Lower Bounds and Heuristics for Unit-Capacity Resource Constrained ProjectScheduling Problem with Transfer Times, written by Ying Liu, Jing Zhou, Andrew Lim, Qian Hu." for the detailed explanation of the parameters.
We appdend on each instance the information of the source instance that is used to generate this instance, the network complexity, the resource factor, and the transfer factor.

Each instance provides information about:
(1) number of activities, number of resources
(2) processing time of each activity
(3) resource requirements of each activity
(4) precedence relationships between activities
(5) resource transfer times for each resource for each pair of activities
(6) the parameters that are used to generate the instance.

So, the data is divided into 5 parts. Each part begins with an anotation which provides information about the value of some parameters.

(1) PROJECT INFORMATION

	# jobs: the number of all activities including dummy activities

	# resources: the number of resource types

	# horizon: it is an large enough upper bound on the project makespan. The readers are referred to the paper "Lower Bounds and Heuristics for Unit-Capacity Resource Constrained ProjectScheduling Problem with Transfer Times, written by Ying Liu, Jing Zhou, Andrew Lim, Qian Hu." for how the horizon is calculated.

(2) PRECEDENCE RELATIONS
	
	jobnr: the id of each activty , starting with 0

	# successors: the number of (direct) successors of each activity

	successors: (direct) successors of each activity

(3) REQUESTS/DURATIONS
	
	jobnr: the id of each activty, starting with 0

	duration: processing time of each activity

	#requiredResources: the number of required resources for each activity. It is assumed all resources are initially located at activity 0 and finally collected at activity n+1.

	requiredResources: detailed resource requirements of each activity. Resource starts with 0

(4) TRANSFER TIMES

	a series of matrices, the element in row i and column j of the k-matrix indicating the transfer time of resource k from activity i to activity j

(5) Parameters setting

	such as
	```
	based on instance j301_1.sm
	network complexity = 1.5
	resource factor = 0.25
	transfer factor = 0.25
	``` 
	in the instance j30_4_1.rcp

	It means this instance j30_4_1.rcp is generated by modifying the instance j301_1.sm (for the resource constrained project scheduling problem), and in the instance j30_4_1.rcp, network complexity = 1.5, resource factor = 0.25, and transfer factor = 0.25.

	At last, we summary the instances according to different values of parameters.

	network complexity

		1.5: index = 1,...,9
		1.8: index = 10,..., 18
		2.1: index = 19,..., 27
	
	resource factor

		0.25: index % 9 ∈ [1, 2, 3]
		0.50: index % 9 ∈ [4, 5, 6]
		0.75: index % 9 ∈ [7, 8, 9]
	
	transfer factor
	 	0.25: index % 9 ∈ [1, 4, 7]
	 	0.50: index % 9 ∈ [2, 5, 8]
	 	0.75: index % 9 ∈ [3, 6, 9]
